/**
 * Target app: Sync for Reddit (com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync), v23.06.30-13:39. For
 * a user who has already purchased Sync Ultra, this permanently unlocks it locally so
 * it no longer depends on the abandoned app's validation servers staying up (or on a
 * revoke push arriving over FCM), and stops the now-pointless periodic
 * re-verification network call.
 *
 * Confirmed by hand from real smali (via apktool):
 *
 * - Luc/b;->j()Z is the single "is Ultra unlocked" gate used by 30+ call sites
 *   app-wide. Forcing it to always return true unlocks every Ultra-gated feature.
 *
 * - ValidateUltraLifetimeJob's private i(Lj8/a;)V is what actually calls Firebase's
 *   "checkLifetimeCallable" function; its result has no other effect (both its
 *   success and failure paths just call onFinished()), so it's replaced with an
 *   immediate onFinished() call, preserving the WorkManager job's completion
 *   contract while skipping the network call entirely.
 *
 * - UltraGrabPaintsJob/UltraGrabTagsJob fetch real, visible Ultra features (other
 *   users' custom highlight colors and text tags, cloud-synced via Firebase
 *   Functions "getPaints"/"getTags") rather than license data. Per explicit user
 *   choice, this patch also disables their schedule triggers (static m()V in each),
 *   stopping all further paint/tag sync — existing local data is unaffected, but it
 *   will no longer update from the server.
 *
 * All changes are made by prepending an early return before the original method
 * body (matching this project's template pattern), leaving the now-unreachable
 * original instructions in place rather than removing them.
