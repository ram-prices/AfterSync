/**
 * Target app: Sync for Reddit (com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync), v23.06.30-13:39.
 *
 * Confirmed by hand via apktool: PreferencesBackupFragment's setup method
 * (Lpa/q;->C3) wires up "ultra_backup_all"/"ultra_backup_restore"/"ultra_backup_delete"
 * by key with no null checks, then gates the whole "ultra_backup" category's visibility
 * (also looked up by key), as the very last thing the method does before its final
 * return-void. With those rows deleted from cat_backup.xml by
 * removeUltraCloudBackupResourcesPatch, this crashes the Backup settings screen on
 * open the same way past preference removals have.
 *
 * This patch removes that entire block — anchored on the unique "ultra_backup_all"
 * string constant, removed through to (but not including) the method's final
 * return-void, the same safe pattern already used for the "mod" credits block in
 * rebrandAboutSetupPatch.kt. Because this block is the last thing the method does,
 * there's no code after it that could depend on any register it sets (unlike the
 * Developer-options removal, which needed care for exactly that reason).
 *
 * Depends on removeUltraCloudBackupResourcesPatch (the XML deletion) so selecting
 * either one in Morphe Manager applies both together.
