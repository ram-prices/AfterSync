/**
 * Target app: Sync for Reddit (com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync), v23.06.30-13:39.
 *
 * Confirmed by hand from real resources (via apktool): there are two separate
 * purchase-restore surfaces.
 *
 * 1. The root settings screen's "Restore purchases" entry (res/xml/cat_root.xml),
 *    which opens res/xml/cat_purchases.xml (a lone PurchasesPreference). Its click
 *    handler clears the "remove_ads" flag and reopens a Play Billing / Firebase
 *    verification dialog for the ad-removal purchase. The same PurchasesPreference
 *    is also used by res/xml/cat_onboarding_purchases.xml during first-run
 *    onboarding.
 * 2. The Sync Ultra screen (res/xml/cat_ultra.xml) has its own "Restore subscription"
 *    button (UltraRestorePreference) and a dev-only "Reset subscription locally
 *    (debugging)" button (UltraResetPreference), independent of (1) and specific to
 *    Ultra.
 *
 * Since unlockUltraPatch and removeAdsPatch already force Ultra unlocked and ads off
 * unconditionally at their respective gate functions — ignoring the SharedPreferences
 * state these restore/reset buttons read and write entirely — none of this has any
 * effect on the app's behavior anymore either way. Removing the root-menu and Ultra
 * screen navigation entries makes UltraRestorePreference/UltraResetPreference (and
 * their layouts, deleted below) permanently unreachable — the practical equivalent of
 * deleting that code, since this patcher's API has no way to excise classes from the
 * compiled app outright (confirmed: no such method exists on BytecodePatchContext or
 * anywhere else in the patcher).
 *
 * cat_purchases.xml / cat_onboarding_purchases.xml and PurchasesPreference are NOT
 * fully cleaned up the same way — see the comment at their delete() call site below
 * for why: a second, independent entry point into that screen exists elsewhere in the
 * app, found by hand in real smali.
 *
 * Deleting the "Restore purchases" entry alone crashed the root settings screen on
 * open — see removeRestorePurchasesSetupPatch.kt for why and what it fixes.
