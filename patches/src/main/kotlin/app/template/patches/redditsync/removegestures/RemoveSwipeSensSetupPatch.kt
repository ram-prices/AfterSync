/**
 * Target app: Sync for Reddit (com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync), v23.06.30-13:39.
 *
 * Confirmed via a real device crash log and the actual smali (via apktool):
 * the General-settings fragment's onCreatePreferences method looks up the
 * "swipe_sens" preference by key, then:
 *   1. Passes it to a private helper that (among other things) calls
 *      .getValue() directly on it with no null check, to set its summary
 *      text — this is the exact call that crashed with a
 *      NullPointerException once "swipe_sens" no longer existed in the XML.
 *   2. Immediately after, looks it up again and registers an
 *      OnPreferenceChangeListener on it — also with no null check, which
 *      would crash the same way even after fixing (1).
 *
 * "swipe_hide" and "swipe_dim" (the other two Gestures preferences) are
 * never referenced anywhere in this fragment, so they need no code changes
 * — only removeGesturesSettingsPatch's XML deletion applies to them.
 *
 * This patch removes both blocks of dead code (from the single
 * const-string "swipe_sens" instruction through to just before the method's
 * final return-void — that string is loaded once and its register reused
 * for both blocks, so there's exactly one instruction to anchor on). With
 * "swipe_sens" genuinely deleted from the XML by removeGesturesSettingsPatch,
 * this code would otherwise always crash the settings screen, so removing it
 * outright — rather than just null-guarding it — is both simpler and leaves
 * no dead/pointless preference lookups behind.
 *
 * This patch depends on removeGesturesSettingsPatch (the XML deletion) so
 * that selecting either one in Morphe Manager applies both together — using
 * only one half without the other would either leave the section visible
 * (bytecode-only) or crash (resource-only).
